# Minimal Developer Portfolio

My Name is Jarrod Kohl and this is a small dev portfolio that I created. Modified from the origial idea and build from Forrest Knight. I like his simple design and so I used that as a basis to create a new build.

This project is a minimal developer portfolio designed to be easy to maintain and update. It provides a clean and straightforward way to showcase your work as a developer. Built with React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS on Vite, it offers a modern and efficient framework for your portfolio.

## Features

- **React**: Utilizes React for efficient UI development.
- **JavaScript**: Leverages JavaScript for dynamic content and functionality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Uses Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive design.
